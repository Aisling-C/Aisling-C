Hi, I’m Aisling. Thanks for checking out my github page.

I've just completed a 7-month month datascience bootcamp offered through Springboard and am excited to see where data science leads me in my career!


As part of the course, I completed two indepdendent capstone projects. You can see these capstone projects in the DataScienceWork repo.  These projects used machine learning to:

* Predict if an ICU patient would develop sepsis or not 

* Project US county diabetes prevalence values using demographic data 



Additionally, I'm proud to contibute to the Data Driven Streets DC project, which aims to make DC streets safer for all through data driven advocacy. The project repo is DC-crash-bot and you can read about some of our work in [this article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-15/how-many-traffic-crashes-are-going-unreported) published in Bloomberg.
