Hi, I’m Aisling. Thanks for checking out my repo.

I've just completed a 6 month datascience bootcamp offered through Springboard. I'm excited for the world of possibilities that data science will open in my career !


As part of the course, I completed two indepdendent capstone projects under the tutelage of an industry mentor. You can see these capstone projects in the DataScienceWork repo.  These projects used machine learning to:

* Predict if an ICU patient would develop sepsis or not 

* Project US county diabetes prevalence values using demographic data 



Additionally, I'm proud to contibute to the Data Driven Streets DC project, which aims to make DC streets safer for all through data driven advocacy.
